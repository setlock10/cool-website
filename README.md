# Cocktail Face Off

Power Rating Cocktails

Once you vote it should tell you there was a x% chance of winning the matchup

Use the ELO rankings


Their expected scores are:

calc = (1.0 / (1.0 + pow(10, ((rating_2 â€“ rating_1) / 400))));

If Garry Kasparov (wins) = 1/1+10 to the power (2200 ? 2500)/400 = 0.849
If Vishwanathan Anand (wins) = 1/1 +10 to the power (2500 ? 2200)/400 = 0.151


Now believe that the Federation has decided that the value of K is 24.

If Garry Kasparov wins

Garry Kasparov = 2500 + 24 (1 - 0.849) = 2503
Vishwanathan Anand = 2200 + 24 (0 - 0.151) = 2196


If Vishwanathan Anand wins

Garry Kasparov = 2500 + 24 (0 - 0.849) = 2479
Vishwanathan Anand = 2200 + 24 (1+ 0.151) = 2220

Huh
